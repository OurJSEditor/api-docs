## Note About The API Calls
The "API Calls" tab of this documentation is a demonstration of the Swagger UI to provide interactive sample calls to the API. Most of this resides in the "console" sub-folder.

This is using the [Open API Specification](http://swagger.io/specification/). Other options provide similar modeling and tooling, including [RAML](http://raml.org/), [API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/), and several more.
